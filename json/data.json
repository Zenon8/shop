Additionally I got HDFC credit card cashback of Rs. 4000/-. \nPhone is excellent in all respect except battery life. I could run battery for one full day only when power saver was kept on continuously. Then display is changed from QHD + to HD+, always on display is not running etc.. So you've to compromise."

      "text": "I opted for the budget friendly 2gb/32gb model because I didn't think the additional RAM would benefit me and I just don't need 64gb storage. I don't take pictures with a tablet so the 5mp/8mp cameras of the Z580CA wasn't attractive either. I wasn't aware until after I purchased the Z580C that the Z580CA model's CPU is 2.3ghz compared the 2gb/32gb model's 1.3ghz. That additional processor power might've been enough to push me into that model had I not already received, setup, and enjoyed the Z580C so far."

To be noted as well that both sim can be active at the same time if desired. \nFinally the vendor delivered the phone quicker then origilly scheduled. \nCan't be happier"

Not sure if mine was defective but I would always get delayed incoming calls for some reason. My signal in the Los Angeles area was not too good. \nNote that you won't be able to use it's built in WiFi calling and Video calling. This is because those are carrier specific services. However, you can always use Google Duo. \nSome bands are also not available in the US. Make sure you inquire about that before purchasing this phone."

Picture quality is noticeable better, richness of, say, leaves on the tree, better than Note 8. \nBattery is main reason for purchase and so far, is still adjusting, but does not seem to be lasting any longer than Note 8. \nThe connectivity is 100% better than the 8, especially by the water where i could not get reception hardly at all. \nIs better than I'd hoped for. \nI had not been aware enough that the charger with the international phone \nis useless here in the states."
